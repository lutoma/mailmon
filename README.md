# mailmon

mailmon does automated mail delivery testing by sending emails using SMTP to a
number of test accounts, then logging in to those accounts using IMAP to see
how long it took for the mail to arrive.

The results can then be submitted to
[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) for monitoring.
